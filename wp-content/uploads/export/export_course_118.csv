wp_posts,4692,post_content,Content,"This course is assessed by a Pearson-set assignment. Students will choose their own project based on a theme provided by Pearson (this will change annually). The project must be related to their specialist pathway of study (unless the student is studying the general computing pathway). This will enable students to explore and examine a relevant and current topical aspect of computing in the context of a business environment and their chosen specialist pathway.

The aim of this course is to offer students the opportunity to engage in sustained research in a specific field of study. The course enables students to demonstrate the capacity and ability to identify a research theme, to develop research aims, objectives and outcomes, and to present the outcomes of such research in both written and verbal formats. The course also encourages students to reflect on their engagement in the research process during which recommendations for future, personal development are key learning points.

On successful completion of this course students will have the confidence to engage in problem-solving and research activities which are part of the function of a manager. Students will have the fundamental knowledge and skills to enable them to investigate workplace issues and problems, determine appropriate solutions and present evidence to various stakeholders in an acceptable and understandable format.

As a result they will develop skills such as communication literacy, critical thinking, analysis, synthesis, reasoning and interpretation which are crucial for gaining employment and developing academic competence.
<h3 class=""heading""><span>Learning Objectives</span></h3>
