<h2><span>The ethical responsibility required from a manager</span></h2>
<span>In this day and age, managers should be aware of what is the significance of ethics, values, approaches to ethical dilemmas and how their organizations can best promote the image of an ethical organization.</span>
<h3><span>Definition of Ethics and Values: </span></h3>
<span>According to a study carried out in USA, 73% of American employees having full time employment said that they had observed ethical misconduct at work, while 36% respondents said that they had been distracted by the ethical misconduct during the course of their employment.<sup><a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a></sup> Most of us have a generic definition of ethics and values but does that definition is applicable in the business world? Let’s consider it.   </span>
<h3><span>Ethics:</span></h3>
<span>Ethics can be called as standards established for determining the right and wrong which influences our behaviours. These standards are likely to vary in countries worldwide and in different cultural settings. Ethical behaviour can be defined as a behaviour that is generally accepted as ‘right’ as compared to ‘wrong’ – according to the underlying concepts of these standards. </span>

<span>How can we differentiate between a tip, a gift, a gratuity, a donation, a consulting fee, a commission, a kickback or perhaps a bribery? Irrespective of the amount of money involved, in every case, we find that the intention is to reward the recipient in order to avail better service, either expected or performed. From the last many years, pharmaceutical companies have been actively involved in providing medical doctors with little gifts such as writing pads with their logos, free tickets to sports events, free samples of their medicines in order to influence the doctors to prescribe the medicines of their brand. However, according to one of the editorials published in a newspaper highlighted that new small gifts have grown into large monies for medical doctors – asking them to persuade other doctors about new drugs in presentations at conventional dinner lectures sponsored by the pharmaceutical companies. Some of the critics, speaking in the favour of such pharma-doctors collaboration, say that these methods used by the pharmaceutical companies could be viewed as advantageous for the medical community in order to expand the knowledge and research about diseases such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Because of such burgeoning concerns worldwide, the government of United States passed a Physician Payments Sunshine Act (PPSA) 2010 was incorporated into the Affordable Care Act 2010, asking the pharmaceutical companies to report all kinds of payments made to individual doctors. </span>

<div class=""focus_box1""><h2><span class=""activity_icon""> </span>Learning Activity 30.1</h2>
<h3><span>Sunshine Act on Gifts</span></h3>
According to some doctors, the field of medicine is changing so rapidly that they have to rely on the pharmaceutical companies and fellow doctors in order to keep themselves updated with the latest treatment guidelines. Presentations of various doctors at medical society dinners, sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, help them update their knowledge and practice. However, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (PPSA) now has made it obligatory for all the pharmaceutical companies in US to report all kinds of expenditure incurred in relation to physicians such as meals, research grants, travel expenses, lecture honoraria, conference grants, free samples of drugs and other miscellaneous gifts made to physicians.

<strong>Question: </strong>

What is your opinion about this Physician Payments Sunshine Act (PPSA) passed in the United States in 2010? Do you think such disclosures are necessary and will bring more transparency in financial reporting of pharmaceutical companies? (Write 200 words)

<h3><span>Values:</span></h3>
<span>Ethical dilemmas often occur as a result of an organizational value system. It’s about the pattern of values established within an organization. Values are considerably permanent and rooted deeply in the core beliefs and attitudes aim to help determine the behaviour of a person. For instance, it can be a belief that “Fairness in recruitment and selection means employing in accordance with the skills and abilities of a person, instead of his/her family background”. Values and value systems are the foundations for ethics and ethical behaviour.</span>

<span>Organizations may have two important value systems existing within the business environment that can be contradictory to each other</span><span>: (1) the value system emphasizing upon financial performance versus (2) the value system emphasizing upon cohesion and harmony relationships amongst employees. </span>

<span>The levels of moral development in most students are established by personalities and upbringing well before they advance to get admission in colleges and some are being more advanced than others. An illustrious psychologist, Laurence Kohlberg proposed three levels of personal and moral development terming them as pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional. </span>

<span><strong>Level 1: Pre-conventional</strong>:</span> This level <span>follows rules. Individuals who achieve this level tend to follow directions and obey orders of authority for avoiding unpleasant circumstances. Managers at the Level 1 have a tendency to show more autocratic or intimidating behaviour, expecting employees to be compliant for the sake of obedience.</span>

<span><strong>Level 2: Conventional</strong>:</span> This level tends to <span>follow the expectations of others. If the moral development of people has reached the level 2, they are more conformist but not slavish, usually following the expectations of other people in their lives. Managers of Level 2 lead by inspiration and collaboration and are inclined towards working in a team oriented manner. Most of the most are found working at this level. </span>

<span><strong>Level 3: Post-conventional</strong>:</span><span> This level is well and truly guided by the internal values. The furthest along in the moral development, the Level 3 managers have independent souls and are driven by their own core values and standards, laying a heavy emphasis upon the needs of their employees and will try to lead by empowering the people working for them. It is generally believed that only about one-fifth of the managers in the United States have reached this level. </span>
<h2><span>How Organizations Can Promote Ethics?</span></h2>
<span>Ethics is not a one-time thing but nowadays has become a matter of everyday routine matters</span><span>. It is for this reason that many large corporations worldwide have started to employ a permanent Chief Ethics Officer, who responsibility is to make sure that the business affairs are conducted in an ethical manner. There are a number of ways with the help of which an organization can promote high level ethical standards in a business; some of which are discussed below: </span>
<h3><span>1. Developing a Strong Ethical Environment: </span></h3>
<span>An ethical environment is representative of the perceptions of employees about the degree to which the work environment support manifestation of ethical behaviour. It is extremely important for the manager to foster an ethical environment because they are in a position to significantly influence the frequency of ethical attitudes and behaviours. Managers have the option to promote ethical environment through official policies and procedures that are applied to business practices on a daily basis. </span>
<h3><span>2. Screening of Potential Employees on Regular Basis:</span></h3>
<span>Businesses remain engaged in a continuous process to remove dishonest, reckless employees by verifying the resumes and references of applicants. For instance, some firms have the ability to run the applications of employees through online verification systems such as obtaining online information from the Home Office of UK, in order to check the potential status of an employee immigration. In UK, for example, you can be fined up to £20,000 for hiring illegal workers. Some firms have the ability to utilize personality tests, integrity tests, psychometric tests etc to remove the potentially dishonest people during the recruitment process.  </span>
<h3><span>3. Instituting a Code of Ethics and Training Programs: </span></h3>
<span>A code of ethics comprises of a written documentation of ethical standards in order to guide organizational actions. Most of the codes provide guidance as how to treat customers, competitors, suppliers and other stakeholders. The broader purpose is to clearly delineate the expectations of the top management for all employees. As you would normally expect that most of such codes would strictly prohibit bribes, commissions, kickbacks, misappropriate of funds or corporate assets, false financial reporting and accounting, conflicts of interests and other pertinent records. Some of the other areas that are getting increased attention of the corporate policies are also covered in such ethical codes such as political contributions, diversity of workforce and confidentiality of organizational information.  </span>
<h3><span>4. Rewards for Ethical Behaviour &amp; Protection of Whistle Blowers:  </span></h3>
<span>It will not be adequate to only punish or penalize bad behaviour. Managers should also be involved in fostering an environment to reward good ethical behaviour as well as to encourage whistle blowers. A whistle blower could be an organizational employee or someone from outside who provides information about organizational misconduct to the general public on such matters as health and safety, wastes, overcharging of customers or fraudulent financial reporting. True whistle blowing usually involves actions that are against the law. However, according to one research study, the primary example of misconduct such as misappropriation of company time, offensive language and behaviour and speaking lies to employees are not necessarily illegal at all. Retaliation against whistle blowers nowadays seems to be extremely high. </span>

<span>A recent example is the famous Edward Snowden who leaked information about the mass surveillance program of United States to the global audience and now he has been charged with Espionage Act violations and his passport has been revoked. Nowadays, he is living in Moscow, Russia, on Asylum. While exposing an unethical behaviour, it is important to be absolutely clear as to why you are doing it. Perhaps could be in an attempt to help the company or want someone else you don’t like to get in trouble. It’s always advisable to stop from reporting for a wrong reason, follow appropriate channels of communication (such as discuss with your supervisor) and you may find someone who could solve the issue without the issue being disclosed across the entire company or public at large. </span>

<div class=""focus_box1"">
<h2><span class=""activity_icon""> </span>Learning Activity 30.2</h2>
<h2><span>Employment for Special People with Disabilities and Newly Married Women</span></h2>
<span>Let’s suppose you have come to learn that a multinational company is going to build an office in your local community. The company is likely to provide employment to about 800 local people. You overheard the HR manager saying to his Chief Human Resource Officer (CHRO) that they will not employ special people with disabilities as this puts an extra burden for the HR department to facilitate their work related needs. You also heard that they are less likely to employ newly married women as there will be an increased frequency of providing fully-paid maternity leave of 4 months and it becomes hard to find a replacement to employ someone for a short-term period of merely 4 months. </span>

<strong><span>Question:   </span></strong>

You want to report this matter to someone who could take any considerable action against these two discriminating policies of the HR department. In order to solve this ethical dilemma, you can speak to the other executive or non-executive members sitting on the board of directors. Secondly, you may speak to the local public office to take an immediate notice of this wrongful policy. Will you suggest a quota system to be introduced for these vulnerable groups or something else?

<h2><span>The social responsibility required from a manager</span></h2>
<span>Managers should be aware of the standpoints that support and oppose social responsibility and whether doing good social works compensate financially for the business or not. But the point to think about is whether money is all about what we care about.  If ethical responsibility is pertaining to become a good individual citizen, then social responsibility translates into becoming a good organizational citizen. Speaking in a more formal tune, social responsibility is the duty of a manager to undertake such actions that will not only benefit the interests of the organization but also the society at large. When we assume this responsibility beyond the scope of an individual to an organization, then social responsibility is known as corporate social responsibility (CSR). Corporate social responsibility, as discussed in previous lessons, emphasize upon the corporations to go above and beyond complying with the law and generating a profit. According to the business scholar of the University of Georgia Prof. Archie Carroll, corporate social responsibility remains at the top of a pyramid reflecting the organizational obligations, right up there with other obligations such as legal, economic and ethical, as seen in the Figure 30.1.</span>

[caption id=""attachment_15675"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""734""]<img src=""https://nextgates.se/education/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mop_l30_01.png"" alt="""" width=""734"" height=""456"" class=""size-full wp-image-15675"" /> Figure 30.1: Corporate Social Responsibility Pyramid - Source: Carroll, A.B., 2004. Managing ethically with global stakeholders: A present and future challenge. Academy of Management Perspectives. <span style=""font-size: 16px;""> </span>[/caption]
<h2><span>Is Social Responsibility Worthwhile? </span></h2>
<span>In the olden days of ruthless capitalism, the social responsibility was a rare topic to thought of. The most important goal for any company was to make as much money as possible and the societal consequences be damned. Today for-profit companies have built a general framework of “giving something back” to the society along with taking something out. </span>

<span>Not every person, however, approves these new priorities of social responsibility. Let’s consider the two different viewpoints on social responsibility of organization.</span>
<h3><span>Against Social Responsibility:</span></h3>
<span>According to this viewpoint, the social responsibility of a business is to generate revenue and earn profits. If the company fails to pay heed on maximization of profits, it will naturally become distracted and fail to provide good quality products and services, benefit their shareholders, creation of more jobs and expansion of economic growth – which is arguably the most appropriate social justification for the existence of a business. This viewpoint also takes into account the consideration of setting up operational plants and factories in countries where the tax is minimum and keep the headquarters in the main country such as UK or USA. That’s how the corporation tax will be reduced and the profits will be maximized. </span>
<h3><span>For Social Responsibility:</span></h3>
<span>According to this viewpoint, large corporations are increasingly engaged in carrying out their social responsibilities and rightly so. They owe everything to the society who purchase their products or services. It is therefore that a company should be concerned with the welfare and wellbeing of the society as well as generating profit from the business activities. Beyond the reason of ethical consideration, the main rationale for this viewpoint is that since companies are responsible for creating problems such as environmental pollution; hence, they should step forward and solve them. Furthermore, businesses often have the needful resources for solving problems in such ways that the non-profit organizations do not. Lastly, being a socially responsible organization gives business a favourable public image that can significantly help in averting implausible government regulations.</span>

<h2><span>Organizational Culture </span></h2>
<span>Organizational culture is described as shared values, traditions, norms, principles and ways of doing things that have the potential to influence the way organizational staff act and that even distinguishes one specific organization from other organizations. These shared values and principles have evolved over time in most organizations and determine, to a great extent, how work related tasks are carried out here. Research literature suggests that there are seven dimensions that can capture the core of an organizational culture. These dimensions, as shown in Figure 30.2, range from low levels to high levels. </span>

<span>We can describe an organization utilising these seven dimensions that can give us an amalgamated picture of an organizational culture. As it happens in many organizations, one cultural dimension is often emphasized more as compared to other dimensions. This fundamentally shapes the personality or structure of an organization and the way organizational staff work. For example, we find that at Sony Corporation, the management’s focus is product innovation. The company is always passionate about new product development and work behaviours of employees that support the goal of the organization. Conversely, Southwest Airlines of United States has made its employees a pivotal part of the organizational culture i.e. it is a people oriented organization. </span>

[caption id=""attachment_15677"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""900""]<a href=""https://nextgates.se/education/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mop_l30_02.jpg"" rel=""prettyphoto"" class=""prettyphoto""><img src=""https://nextgates.se/education/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mop_l30_02.jpg"" alt="""" width=""900"" height=""599"" class=""wp-image-15677 size-full"" /></a> Figure 30.2: Seven Dimensions of an Organizational Culture[/caption]
<h2><span>How Culture Can Affect Managers?</span></h2>
<span>Apache Corporation, a company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration, is well-organized in Delaware and have its headquarters in Houston, Texas, USA. Apache Corporation has become one of the top performers in the </span>

<span>oil drilling business. The key reason of its success is the culture embedded in the organizational values. The culture values taking risk opportunities and fast decision making. Potential employees for the company are selected on the basis of how much initiative they have been in the past employments in order to get the projects done effectively and timely. The employees of the company get hefty rewards if they the pre-determined targets of profit and production. Usually an organizational culture curbs the authorities of its employees as what they can and what they cannot do and how are they going to manage. This is particularly important for managerial implications. </span>

<span>Usually, managers are not likely to follow programs that, in true essence, are innovative, long-term, risky or expansionary. Where an organizational culture reflects an environment of basic distrust amongst employees, there is an increased likelihood that managers will be using an authoritarian leadership style instead of a democratic one. You must be wondering, why? It is the organizational culture that establishes for the managers suitable and predicted behaviour. For instance, Banco Santander, a commercial bank and a financial services company, headquartered about 20 kilometres from downtown Madrid, has been labelled as risk averse control freak. The manager working at the company strictly adhere to the rigorous virtues of banking system based on conservatism and patience. However, it is the result of these cultural values that substantially activated the growth of the company and today it is one of the leading banks in the euro zone, whereas few years ago it was rated as the sixth biggest bank in Spain only.  </span>

<span>As shown in Figure 30.3, the decisions of a managers are strongly influenced by the organizational culture in which he or she has to operate. An organizational culture, especially if it’s a strong one, tremendously influences and limit the authorities of managers in planning, organizing, leading and controlling. </span>
